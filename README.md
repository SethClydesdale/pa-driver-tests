# Pennsylvania Driver Tests
Pennsylvania Driver Tests is a tool created to help aid those studying the Pennsylvania Driver's Manual, by providing free online exercises for testing your driver knowledge. The tests are based on the ones provided in the PennDOT driver's manual, allowing you to quickly review after each chapter without having to check your answers by hand. It can be used online or offline depending on your needs. Choose one of the links below to begin testing what you've learned!


**Online Version :** https://sethclydesdale.github.io/pa-driver-tests/

**Offline Version :** [download](https://github.com/SethClydesdale/pa-driver-tests/archive/master.zip)


### Using the Offline Version
If you're using the offline version you'll have to unzip the files. Once you've done that, you can access all the tests by opening any of the **index.html** files in the browser of your choice. It should have the same experience as the online version, however, whenever new changes are made they wont be available; you'll have to download the latest version of the repository to get them.
